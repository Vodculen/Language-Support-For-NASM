# Language Support For NASM

Language Support for NASM implements refactoring, Intellisense, and formatting for NASM.

## Features

- **Syntax Highlighting** to make reading and debugging the code a bit easier. It has a consistent highlighting style between: 
	- Keywords
	- Strings 
	- Comments
	- Numbers *(hex, dec, oct, bin)*
	- Registers
	- Operators
	- Labels *(Builtin, User-defined)*
- **Code Snippets** making repetitive parts of Assembly quicker and easier to write. Such as variable and label declaration, "Hello world!" program, the boilerplate to make a runnable program, and more to come.
- **Error Checker** to make it easier to fix the code without having to run it in the Terminal every-time.
- **Autocompletion** for the people who are to lazy to type out a 3 letter mnemonic instruction *(me included)*.
- **More Coming Soon!**
