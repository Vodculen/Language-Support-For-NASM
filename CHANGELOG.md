The Change Log for all notable changes to Language Support For NASM

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - 2025-10-25

### Added
- Error Checker to make it easier to see errors in the codebase without having to assemble the program
- Syntax Highlighter making the code colorful and easier to read and debug. They have similar colors to what they are *(Registers, Instructions, etc.)*.
- Autocompletion for all the instructions, builtin labels, and registers for quicker and easier programming, and for the lazy programmers!
- Code Snippets making repetitive parts of Assembly quicker and easier to write. Such as variable and label declaration, "Hello world!" program, and the boilerplate to make a runnable program.
- Hoverer to tell you what the instructions somewhat do, for now it just tells you what group every instruction is in
